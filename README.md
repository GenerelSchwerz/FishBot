# FishBot

MineBot is a WebGUI based client targeted towards users of any version-its compatible for 1.12.2-1.16.x. It can be localhosted and can connect multiple bots simultaneously
and can run in the background while you play on your main with no issues. The point of MineBot is to cut down the grinding players have on popular servers while still being able to enjoy the game.

MineBot is based on PrismarineJS and is a node.js script. This is to cut down resources that other alternatives (like Baritone) would use. Leaving minecraft accounts running can be costly to RAM consumption and GPU usage. MineBot circumnavigates this by communicating with the server via packets instead of in-game inputs. Minecraft doesn't have to run at all.
